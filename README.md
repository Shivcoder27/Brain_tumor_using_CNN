# Brain Tumor Detection Model Using CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model to detect brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The model achieves high accuracy in classifying MRI scans as tumor or non-tumor and is designed for practical usability with a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate tumor detection.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, resizing, and data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Deployed with an intuitive interface for real-time detection.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved robust classification between tumor and non-tumor cases.

## Dataset (Contact for datasets)
The model is trained on an MRI brain tumor dataset consisting of labeled images. The dataset is preprocessed to include:
- Resizing images to a uniform size.
- Normalizing pixel values for consistency.
- Applying augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)).

## Model Architecture
The CNN model includes:
1. Convolutional layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
2. Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
3. Fully connected layers for classification.
4. Softmax activation for output probabilities.

The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
